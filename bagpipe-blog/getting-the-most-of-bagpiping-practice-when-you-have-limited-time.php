					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">One of the biggest impediments to getting better at bagpiping is not bagpiping (believe it or not).  <span class="italic">It’s really that simple.</span>  I probably don’t need to list them off for you.  But aside from our duties, responsibilities, and perhaps even our bad or non-productive habits, there is a need to practice, that is, if we are proactively trying to improve (or at least not get worse).  If we are a beginner this is absolutely necessary because a new student has to repeatedly commit to practice, or they will give up.  There really isn’t any way around that.</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">But perhaps if we already reached our initial goals, whether it be playing with a band, playing a favorite tune, or whatever, do we set new goals?  Or do we let our skills rot away because of excuses?</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">When a student is young they usually have more time on their hand.  This is a double edged sword because although they have more time to practice, they also have more time to waste.  If they are practicing then they have more luxury to not practice as efficiently.   Assuming that they are practicing.</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">As a person gets older and more saturated with other obligations, then they need to be more committed to practice if they want to get better.  The younger person who once had the luxury of extra time has to either sacrifice time from non-bagpiping activities or get more efficient with their bagpiping practice.  This is why a lot of young people give up hobbies when they enter college or get older.  And that’s a shame because younger people tend to <span class="italic">have the ability</span> to learn much faster.</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Older adults however, if they are focused, can usually find a few minutes a day to practice.  Whether it’s 5 minutes or 60 minutes, they can do it if they don’t make excuses.</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p"><span class="italic light-bold">"If you want to do something you’ll find a way, if not you’ll find an excuse."</span> -Jim Rohn</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Once the excuses are gone, and assuming you don’t have the luxury of time of a school student, then how do you get the most of your time?</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p"><span class="light-bold">DO NOT PLAY ON THE PRACTICE CHANTER.</span></p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Just play on the actual bagpipes.  It is more difficult and exerting to do so.  Therefore you are better off doing so if you only have a limited amount of time.  Nobody cares about the great highland practice chanter; it’s the bagpipes that count.</p>
					<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Can’t play the bagpipes because of (insert excuse here)?  Then figure out a way to make it work.  Unless you <span class="light-bold">can't honestly</span> play on the bagpipes, then and only then pick up the practice chanter.  It’s your time.  Time is limited.</p>
