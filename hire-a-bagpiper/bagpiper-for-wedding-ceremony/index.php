					Nothing makes a wedding ceremony more joyous and lively than having a bagpiper play.  A typical 
					ceremony may have a piper welcome guests as they enter the church with joyous music before entering
					a church.  After the ceremony is over music welcomes the guests to celebrate the newly wedded couple.
					You may also choose to incorporate having a piper play during the ceremony as well.

					Simply give us a call or email and provide us with the details of the wedding ceremony.  We are open to special requests,
