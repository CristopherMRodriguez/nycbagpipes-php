				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">NYC Bagpipes' Cristopher Rodriguez attended the <a href="http://www.invermark.org/">Invermark Summer Piping and Drumming School</a> in person for the first time.  The Invermark school was taught by some of the top bagpipe and drum competitors in the world, including last year's Glenfiddich champion Jack Lee, 8x Glenfiddich winner Willie McCallum, 10x World Championship winner and lead drummer of Inverary & District Pipe Band Steven McWhirter. Other prominent instructors included Donald Lindsay, Iain MacHarg, Maureen Connor, Eric MacNeill, and Christina Henry.  The piping and drumming syllabus included an array of topics for students; many of the students are active solo competitors in the piping and drumming community of the United States.  The 6 day intensive program also featured performances from the above instructors, contests for the students where prizes were awarded, and a ceilidh.  The school was held at Jiminy Peak Ski Resort in Massachusetts, which is a brand new location for the school.  The 2022 school marked the first time that lessons were taught in person since 2019.  The Invermark Piping and Drumming Summer School was started by Donald Lindsay and his father James F. Lindsay in 1962 with the goal of offering world class instruction to students in a setting reminiscent of the Scottish landscape.  In 2021 Cristopher Rodriguez of NYC Bagpipes <a href="https://www.nycbagpipes.com/bagpipe-blog/donald-lindsay-history-of-the-bagpipes.php">interviewed Donald Lindsay</a> and discussed the beginnings of the Invermark School.</p>
