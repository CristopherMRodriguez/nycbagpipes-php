				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">NYC Bagpipes publicly announced today that the development of a bagpipe club is in the works and is to be held in New York City.  Discussions have already been made with a venue in Manhattan to provide a space; the venue agreed to accommodate bagpipe playing indoors.  The event will be held sometime in early 2022 (January or February).</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">As part of the premier for the club, it is anticipated that a few reputable, professional-grade bagpipers from the Northeast area will perform at the event.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">The purpose of the club is to make it open to anyone who wants to perform, at any level.  Even non-bagpipers, who have a love for the instrument, will be encouraged to learn and enjoy the event.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">The idea for the event was inspired by the Scottish Piper's Association who had regular meetups in Glasgow, Scotland.  Notable bagpipers such as Donald McLeod use to perform there.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Cristopher Rodriguez from NYC Bagpipes, who is organizing the event, hopes that this will inspire bagpipers and grow the piping community and bagpiping associations.  His website is <a href="https://www.nycbagpipes.com">https://www.nycbagpipes.com</a>.</p>
