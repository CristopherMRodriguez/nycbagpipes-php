				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Cristopher Rodriguez earned his first Grade 2 Solo Bagpipe AGL (above grade level) on June 27th, 2021 at the Round Hill Highland Games in Lime Rock, CT.  Cristopher Rodriguez earned the AGL competing in the 2/4 March event.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Joe Brady Jr. was the judge for the event; he requested the tune <span class="italic">Arthur Bignould of Lochrosque</span> to be performed from the 2 tunes submitted for the 2/4 March event, as required by the Eastern United States Pipe Band Association (EUSPBA) rules for Grade 2 Solo bagpipers.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">AGL's are a factor in determining whether a competitor will be upgraded at the end of the season to the next, higher grade for the EUSPBA. Should Cristopher Rodriguez be upgraded, he would then be placed in the Grade 1 Amateur category for EUSPBA solo bagpipers. Above Grade 1 would be the highest grade that can be reached, which is the Professional Grade.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Cristopher Rodriguez finished 2nd place overall for the 2/4 march event.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Aside from competing, Cristopher Rodriguez runs NYC Bagpipes, a service that allows people to hire a bagpiper or to learn how to play the bagpipes.</p>
