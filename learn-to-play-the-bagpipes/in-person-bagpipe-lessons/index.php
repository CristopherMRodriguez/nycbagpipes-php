					There are many advantages to learning bagpipes in person.  The subtleties of communicating
					musically are not lost; it is easier to verbally communicate; and there are no online technical issues. 
					It gets us off being online, fully immersing the student and teacher in each other's presence with focus.  
					Furthermore, when the student is ready
					to move onto learning the bagpipes, the aspect of maintaining the bagpipes becomes a critical skill
					that must not be overlooked. Having in-person bagpipe lessons helps the student gain confidence to maintain 
					an instrument that is in good shape. The student also gets into the habit
					of performing in front of another person, in a live setting.
