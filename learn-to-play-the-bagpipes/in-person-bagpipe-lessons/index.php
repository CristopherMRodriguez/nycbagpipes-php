					There are many advantages to learning bagpipes in person.  The subtleties of communicating
					music ideas are not lost; it is easier to communicate; and there are no online technical issues. 
					It also gets us off being online.  Furthermore, when the student is ready
					to move onto learning bagpipes, the aspect of maintaining the bagpipes becomes a critical skill
					that is often overlooked. Having in-person bagpipe lessons helps the student gain confidence that 
					they are playing on an instrument that is in good shape. The student also gets into the habit
					of performing in front of another person.
