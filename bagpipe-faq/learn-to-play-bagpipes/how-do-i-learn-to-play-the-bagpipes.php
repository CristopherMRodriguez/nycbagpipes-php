				<h3 class="section-subtitle blog-h3">How do I learn to play the bagpipes?</h3>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">If you haven't already, <a target="blank" href="/bagpipe-blog/learn-to-play-the-bagpipes-blog.php">read this blog article</a> to get a nice breakdown to learn how to play the bagpipes.</p>  
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">In short the best way to learn is to hire a qualified instructor, which we have at NYC Bagpipes. It is detrimental not to do so.</p>  
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p section-border-space">You will need to start off on a practice chanter, which is an easy-to-play version of the bagpipe. On the practice chanter you begin by learning how to play exercises, embellishments, and tunes before moving onto a real bagpipe. Once on the bagpipe you will learn how to develop stamina, maintenance skills, and tone improvement. Hiring a tutor is the most efficient way to help you along all of these important steps.</p>  
				
				<div class="section-border"></div>
				<h3 class="section-subtitle blog-h3">What if I don’t need a tutor!? I want to learn on my own!</h3>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">I would only recommend it ONLY under the following conditions: </p>
        
        <ul class="blog-list section-p blog-post-p">
          <li class="blog-list-item">Lesson cost is a factor</li>
					<li class="blog-list-item">You already have a background in a musical instrument</li>
					<li class="blog-list-item">You understand rhythm and pitch</li>
					<li class="blog-list-item">You know how to sight read (not necessary but a big plus)</li>
				</ul>
        
        <p class="section-p blog-post-p section-border-space">However, I still don’t recommend that you learn on your own. At the very least, get instruction from a bagpipe band-ideally from a high quality bagpipe band. If you are in the tri-state area, <a href="mailto: nycbagpipes@gmail.com">email me</a> for suggestions.</p>
        
        <div class="section-border"></div>
				<h3 class="section-subtitle blog-h3">What do I need to buy to start learning how to play the bagpipes?</h3>
        <ul class="blog-list section-p blog-post-p">
          <li class="blog-list-item"><a target="blank" href="https://www.hendersongroupltd.com/product/mccallum-long-poly-practice-chanter-with-imitation-ivory/">A practice chanter</a></li>
					<li class="blog-list-item section-border-space"><a target="blank" href="https://www.hendersongroupltd.com/product/piping-centre-green-book-volume-1-with-web-videos/">A learning book.</a> If you hire me as a tutor, I can provide you with free learning material!</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="section-border"></div>
				<h3 class="section-subtitle blog-h3">Why Hire a Tutor?</h3>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">You will save a tremendous amount of time. If you have a qualified instructor and you commit to practicing regularly, you can play on a bagpipe in 1-2 years time.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">If you learn on your own, you risk:</p>
        <ul class="blog-list section-p blog-post-p">
          <li class="blog-list-item">Taking much longer</li>
					<li class="blog-list-item">Learning incorrectly</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">Having a coach/instructor is a great way for them to impart their knowledge onto you. They will pinpoint certain things that you MUST learn in order to progress. They will also tailor the sessions to what you need to learn and when you need to learn them.</p>
				<p class="section-p blog-post-p bold section-border-space">At the very least, if you can’t afford a tutor, get free instruction from a bagpipe band that offers it. However, getting a qualified tutor is still much better. A great teacher can make you become a great player; a bad band instructor will make you become a bad player.</p>
