				<p class="section-p blog-post-p">For events I have travelled as far as Camden, NJ; upstate NY; Western Connecticut; and the tip of Long Island to perform. For highland bagpipe competitions I have travelled to New Hampshire (over 7 hour drive) and to Virginia (8 hours). In short, bagpiping and driving are synonymous; we will literally go the extra distance to make sure you have an excellent bagpiper for your special event!</p>
